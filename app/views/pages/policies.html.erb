<h1>ERA Content Policy</h1>
<p>ERA preserves and makes accessible material related to teaching and research activities at the University of Alberta and partner institutions. By providing an open access environment for researchers to self-archive and share their research, ERA supports the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications. Canadian researchers whose home institution does not currently maintain an institutional repository can deposit their research with ERA, which is designated as an adoptive repository by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries.

Undergraduate student work must be vetted by a Faculty or Department, or through consultation with the Digital Repository Services Librarian, before deposit in ERA. 

ERA provides a mediated deposit service [link to how to deposit] which can help researchers determine if their material is appropriate for deposit, and can provide support in determining licensing and publisher permissions.

Please contact us <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> for more information about depositing in ERA.
</p>


<h1>Digital Preservation Statement for ERA</h1>
<p>UAL employs a number of strategies to ensure the preservation of digital material within ERA. Preservation is about more than just keeping a backup copy. It requires a commitment to monitoring and actively maintaining the content so that future generations will be able to find, discover and use today’s digital material regardless of changes to formats and technologies.   Our strategies are informed by relevant standards and community best practices. For more information please visit Technologies and Partnerships <a href="/technology">Technology and Partnerships</a>.
</p>

<h1>ERA Take-Down Policy</h1>
<p>The removal of an item from ERA once it is deposited is generally discouraged. However,
items will be temporarily taken down under the following scenarios until a determination is made to either restore or permanently remove the item:
A copyright dispute emerges requiring investigation.
There is disagreement among multiple authors over whether the item should be placed in ERA. It is in the best interests of depositors to seek co-author permission prior to deposit.

Items will be removed immediately if:
We become aware of any illegal activity facilitated by an item in ERA.
An ERA item is used for internet nuisance activity by a user, such as to spam others.
</p>


<h1>Metadata Quality Policy</h1>
<p>Detailed policy and practice workflows exist to ensure that ERA metadata is of the highest possible quality. Metadata already within ERA may undergo enhancement on an ad-hoc or project basis. This allows for optimum collation, dissemination, and preservation of ERA content. Contact <a href="mailto:eraadmi@ualberta.ca">eraadmi@ualberta.ca</a> for more information.
