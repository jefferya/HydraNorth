M.|Richmond, R. J.|Price, M. A.|Berg, R. T.",,"The growth and distribution of fat from 163 pig carcasses were compared among five breeds (Duroc × Yorkshire (D × Y), Hampshire × Yorkshire (H × Y), Yorkshire (Y × Y), Yorkshire × Lacombe-Yorkshire (Y × L-Y) and Lacombe × Yorkshire (L × Y)) and two sex-types (barrows and gilts) over a wide range in carcass weight. The growth pattern of fat and the fat depots were estimated from the allometric equation (Y = aXb) using side muscle weight and side fat weight separately as independent variables. Growth coefficients (b) for intermuscular and subcutaneous fat depots were similar for the hindquarter but the intermuscular depot coefficient was slightly higher for the forequarter. The coefficient for body cavity fat was highest in all comparisons. No significant differences were detected for coefficients among breeds and between sexes using both total muscle and total side fat as independent variables. Significant breed and sex-type differences were found in the fat depots at a constant weight of side muscle. This would indicate that breed differences in fatness seemed to be more influenced by the initiation of fattening at different muscle weights than by any inherent differences in rate of fattening. Significant breed differences were also found in the fat depots at a constant fat weight, indicating that breed may influence fat distribution. Sex-type had no effect on fat distribution when the evaluation was made at constant fatness.",fat growth|fat distribution|carcass|pigs|pig production,,"@1980 Jones, S. D. M., Richmond, R.
